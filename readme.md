#esp-just-slip

[SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Line_Internet_Protocol) provides easy to implement method to encapsulate data packets sent over a serial connection. The esp-just-slip is an implementation of SLIP prepared for [ESP8266 SoC](http://espressif.com/en/products/esp8266/). It is provided as C module [justslip](justslip/) and includes verification of data integrity with crc16. Sample implementation of this module is avialable in file [user_main.c](user/user_main.c) and demonstrates sending of data packets between arduino and ESP8266.



##Implementation

esp-just-slip is using [esp8266 software uart](https://github.com/plieningerweb/esp8266-software-uart) by [Andreas Plieninger](https://github.com/plieningerweb) to provide flexibility which pins to use for serial communication. With simple code modification esp-just-slip may be switched to using ESP8266â€™s hardware UART. To provide verification if data has been transmitted correctly [CRC16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crc16) is used.
 


##Sample Test Configuration

Testing of this application may be perfomed with sample h/w set up defined below:



##Hardware
* Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V
* ESP-12E LoLin V3 with serial by wemos.cc
* Two USB-UART generic dongles used to
  * monitor serial trafic received by ESP-12E
  * download Arduino and then monitor serial trafic received by Arduino

The following pins are used to connect particular modules:

Module   | Pin Desription | Pin No. | <> | Pin No. | Pin Desription | Module
-------- | -------------- | ------- |----| --------|----------------| ---------------
ESP-12E  | Soft UART Rx   | GIPIO14 | <> | 11      | Soft UART Tx   | Arduino
ESP-12E  | Soft UART Tx   | GIPIO15 | <> | 10      | Soft UART Rx   | Arduino
ESP-12E  | Ground         | GND     | <> | GND     | Ground         | Arduino
ESP-12E  | UART1 Tx       | GPIO02  | <> | Rx      | UART Rx        | USB-UART ESP 
ESP-12E  | Ground         | GND     | <> | GND     | Ground         | USB-UART ESP 
Arduino  | UART Tx        | TXO     | <> | Rx      | UART Rx        | USB-UART INO 
Arduino  | UART Rx        | RXI     | <> | Tx      | UART Tx        | USB-UART INO 
Arduino  | Reset          | RST     | <> | DTR     | UART DTR       | USB-UART INO 
Arduino  | Power Supply   | RAW     | <> | 5V      | Power Supply   | USB-UART INO 
Arduino  | Ground         | GND     | <> | GND     | Ground         | USB-UART INO 

Please note that most of Arduino modules operate on 5V while ESP8266 on 3.3V To make the connection easeir Arduin Pro Mini 3.3V has been used that provides direct compatibility of pin voltage to ESP8266. In other cases a 5V <> 3.3V voltage level shifter should be used or ESP8266 may be damaged if connected directly to 5V Arduino pins.

##Software Overview
ESP8255 application should be compiled and loaded to module using provided make file. Arduino should be loaded using [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). The sketch is available in folder [ino-just-slip](ino-just-slip/). Functionally of this sketch is identicatl to the application loaded on ESP8266. There are some (slight) differences in code as Arduino is using C++ while ESP8266 is using pure C. 

Once applications are started the following information is displayed on [Arduino Serial](documents/just-slip-arduino-terminal.png) and [ES8266 UART1](documents/just-slip-esp8266-terminal.png) terminals:
 
``` 
...
4F 2E 00 00 AB E6 71 77 4E E0 76 D8 :  2% 
50 2E 00 00 23 80 4D 60 3D B5 DA C8 :  2% 
51 2E 00 00 51 3C 15 59 C6 E6 32 0E :  2% 
...
```
First four columns contain couter of packets received, next 8 bytes contain random data and last column contains percentage of packets lost or currupt. Packets are sent eveery 30 ms at 57600 bps. Checking of UART input buffer for data is done every 10 ms. Basing on observation of the above sample h/w configuration, on averagw about 1% of packets received by Aruino are lost or currupt. On ESP8266 side this value is below 0.5% (0% reported on terminal). The reason of bigger number of packet  lost/corrupt on Arduino side is likely ESP8266 WiFi routines that interrupt operation of SoftUART sending the packets. This is only a hypothesis that should be verified by specific testing.


The following s/w version have been used when developing and testing of esp-just-slip:
* [Unofficial Development Kit for Espressif ESP8266](http://programs74.ru/udkew-en.html) v2.0.8 (esp_iot_sdk_v1.3.0_15_08_08)
* [Arduino iDE 1.6.5](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* [Arduino SoftwareSerial 1.0.0](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SoftwareSerial) - avialable through Arduino iDE > Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries



##Software API

//
// *dataBuffer - pointer to data buffer to calculate and append crc16
// nCount - number of data bytes in dataBuffer
//
// returned value - number of bytes in data buffer including crc16
//
uint8_t ICACHE_FLASH_ATTR appendCrc16(uint8_t *dataBuffer, uint8_t nCount)

// *dataBuffer - pointer to data buffer
// nCount - number of data bytes in dataBuffer including crc16
//
// returned value - true of false depending on result of crc16 check
//

```
Perfrom data integrity check by comparing CRC16 calulated for input data against CRC16 received.
